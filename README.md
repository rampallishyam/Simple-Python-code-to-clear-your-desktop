# Simple-Python-code-to-clear-your-desktop
Using Task scheduler and Python to have a clear desktop on every boot-up

The repository has a single pupose for now and is subject to further development when a need arises. 

Material: A python file(download from rep) which contains the code to sort the files by their extension type and a link to a video with which you can execute this code on boot up every time. Kindly follow the video (link below) and believe me it is very easy. Start an issue if you need help. Cheers!
